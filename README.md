## Overview

Stock Shooters is a Streamlit web application designed to predict market ranges for stock indices. It utilizes data from the Fyers API and performs technical analysis to provide insights into market trends.

## Features

- **Market Range Prediction**: Predicts upper and lower market ranges based on historical data.
- **Customizable Input**: Users can input different stock symbols and timeframes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- Fyers API
- Pandas
- Pandas TA
- Base64

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-shooters.git
   cd stock-shooters
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Update `fyers_login.py`**

   - Ensure that the `fyers_login.py` file contains the correct logic to fetch the access token from the Fyers API.

2. **Background Image**

   - Place your background image in the root directory and name it `background.jpg` or update the `load_image` function in `app.py` to use the correct path.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**

   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to use the application.

## How to Use

1. **Login**

   - Enter the username and password in the login page. The default credentials are:
     - **Username**: `admin`
     - **Password**: `password123`

2. **Predict Market Range**

   - After logging in, enter a stock symbol (e.g., `NSE:NIFTYBANK-INDEX`) and select a timeframe (e.g., 30 minutes).
   - Click the "Predict Market Range" button to see the predicted upper and lower range values.

3. **Logout**

   - Click the "Logout" button in the sidebar to return to the login page.
